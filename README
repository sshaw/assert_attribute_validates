assert_attribute_validates 
=========================

Rails plugin to test ActiveRecord attribute validations with minimal effort.

=========================
Install
=========================

From your Rails project root:

./script/plugin install git://github.com/sshaw/assert_attribute_validates.git

=========================
Examples
=========================

class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :category
  validates_presence_of :name
  validates_associated :category, 'invalid category'
  validates_numericality_of :price, :greater_than => 0
end

class ProductTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  test 'name cannot be blank' do
    assert_attribute_validates
  end

  test 'must have a price greater than 0' do
    assert_attribute_validates :invalid => 0
  end

  test 'must have a valid category' do
    assert_attribute_validates :message => 'invalid category', :valid => lambda { |model| model.category = Category.find_by_name( 'Food' ) }
  end
end

=========================
Requirements
=========================

ActiveRecord, ActiveSupport, Test::Unit::Assertions

=========================
Description
=========================

assert_attribute_validates takes away some of the repetidness involved with testing your ActiveRecord models
by infering what you want to validate from the calling class and method and generating simple test data 
for testing the validation.  Of course, all of this can be tailored to your needs (see Usage below).  

Each call to assert_attribute_validates *can* do three things:

1. Failed Assertion: Assign invalid data to the attribute in question and assert that the validation for the attribute failed
2. Error Message Assertion: Assert that the expected error message was generated upon failure
3. Success Assertion: Assign valid data to the attribute in question and assert that validation for the attribute succeded

1 and 2 depend on the arguments provided to assert_attribute_validates and the attribute's underlying column.
If no invalid value has been provided, or if the attribute's column has a non blank?() default, 1 and 2 will not be asserted.
2 is only asserted if assertion 1 failed and the expected error message was provided.
3 will alway be asserted.

For each of step assert_attribute_validates() calls assert(), so a failue will raise a Test::Unit::AssertionFailedError. 

=========================
Usage
=========================

assert_attribute_validates(*args)

The first argument can be a String or Symbol denoting name of the attribute to validate. If no name is given an 
attempt is made to guess what you want to validate by looking for a model's name in the test class' name, 
and then looking for one of its columns names or associations in the test method's name.

A model's name can only be infered if the test class follows the "ModelTest" naming convention. 

Additional arguments must be given as name/value pairs; all are optional:

:model   - The model to preform validations on. This can be an instance of the model, or a String or Class that 
	   will be used to create an instance. If no argument is given the model will be inferred from the test 
	   class' name. See above.
:valid   - assign the given value to the attribute before performing the Success Assertion. It is expected that 
	   this value will cause the attribute to pass validation. 

	   If the value is a Proc it will be called with the model as its argument.

	   If no value is given one will be generated based on the attribute's datatype or association type.
:invalid - assign the given value to the attribute before performing the Failed Assertion. It is expected that 
	   this value will cause the attribute to fail validation. 

	   If the value is a Proc it will be called with the model as its argument.
:message - assert that a Failed Assertion contins the given message in attribute's errors collection
